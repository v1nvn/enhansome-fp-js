# Awesome FP JS [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) ⭐ 436,832 | 🐛 67 | 📅 2026-01-28 with stars

This is a curated list of awesome [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) code and learning resources for JavaScript. As a multi-paradigm programming language, JavaScript can be written in many styles. With these resources we want to help you to make better use of JavaScript’s support for writing programs in a *functional* way.

Functional programming is a [style of programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming) which models computations as the evaluation of expressions. Contrast this  with imperative programming where programs are composed of statements which change global state when executed. Functional programming typically avoids using mutable state and favors *side-effect free* functions and *immutable* data instead. This encourages writing composable and declarative programs that are easy to reason about.

##### Tags

These may be appended to entries.  Each should be preceded by a "+" or "-" to indicate presence or absence of the tag's meaning.  "-" tags should only be included when they are likely to help someone filter libraries for their needs.  For instance, `-TS` tags are probably useful for Typescript users screening for types, but `-CT` tags would be less likely to be helpful to anyone.

* **CT**.  Category Theory.  This library appears to be inspired by Haskell, Scala, or another functional language's library with a grounding in Category Theory.
* **TS**.  Typescript.  This library has typescript types.
